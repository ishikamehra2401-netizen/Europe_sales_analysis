# Europe Sales Analysis

ðŸ“Š **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing sales records from various countries in Europe.  
The goal was to transform messy raw sales data into a clean, structured dataset and extract useful business insights.  
This project demonstrates my skills in **data cleaning, standardization, and Excel reporting**.

## ðŸ›  What I Did (Process)

1. **Standardized Dates**  
   - The original dataset had mixed date formats.  
   - I reformatted all dates into a single consistent format (DD-MM-YYYY).  

2. **Standardized Priority Levels**  
   - The "Order Priority" column contained inconsistent codes (`C`, `M`, `L`, `H`).  
   - I converted them into clear, human-readable categories:  
     - `C` â†’ **Critical**  
     - `M` â†’ **Medium**  
     - `L` â†’ **Low**  
     - `H` â†’ **High**  

3. **Created Pivot Tables**  
   - Built pivot tables to summarize sales by **country**, **channel**, and **order_priority**, **profit over the years**
   - This helped identify patterns and key performance areas.  

4. **Visualization**  
   - Designed charts and a dashboard in Excel based on the pivot tables.  
   - Visualizations highlighted overall business insights.
